# ZX81-Internal-16K-Expansion 'No Wobbly Edition'
This litlle PCB is a 'quick and dirty, no wobbly' 16K internal memory expansion for the Sinclair ZX81. The ZX81 only has 1KB of memory, it could be expanded to 16KB by using a RAMpack, wich was connected to the expansion port on the back of the computer. It is this RAMpack that was notorious for the infamous 'RAMpack wobble', a certain movement of the computer would cause a crash, resulting in losing work, etc. 

That is where the 'No Wobbly Edition' comes in, it replaces the internal 1KB SRAM with a 32KB SRAM, of which 16KB is usable. All of the necessary re-routing of address lines is done on the PCB, so need to cut tracks on the ZX81 PCB or bending of pins, etc.
